# RStatsEssentialTraining

This is a repository of R files I created in pursuit of completing the R Statsitics Essential Training class through LinkedIn Learning.

Direct from class description:
"Author Barton Poulson shows how to use R to model statistical relationships using graphs, calculations, tests, and other analysis tools. Learn how to enter and modify data; create charts, scatter plots, and histograms; examine outliers; calculate correlations; and compute regressions, bivariate associations, and statistics for three or more variables. Challenge exercises with step-by-step solutions allow you to test your skills as you progress."
